This blog is concerned with my various interests, in and outside of academia.  In particular, data programming, informatics, text-mining and biostatistics. I am interested in open source, open access and open data in academia, bio- and health informatics and distilling complex datasets from a range of sources into meaningful information.

This blog is in its third incarnation.  I first hosted it on Blogger before moving it to [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/). Upon the move, I first built the static site in Clojure using the [Misaki](http://github.com/liquidz/misaki) Static site generator, (which I [edited slightly](http://github.com/DASpringate/misaki) to meet my needs).  Recently, I have changed again to using my own [Samatha](https://github.com/DASpringate/samatha) static site engine which is written entirely in R.  I also use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) as my front-end framework, because I am lazy.
