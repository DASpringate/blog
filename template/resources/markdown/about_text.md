I am a biostatistician and informatician in the [Centre for Biostatistics](http://www.population-health.manchester.ac.uk/biostatistics/) and [Primary Care Research Group](http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/primarycare/) at the University of Manchester.  I work with large-scale Electronic Medical Record Databases containing millions of electronically captured doctor-patient consultations across hundreds of GP practices in order to address important questions in public health.  I am also working to improve accessibility to such data.  In 2012 I completed a PhD in evolutionary biology, studying plastic and genetic responses to environmental changes. My previous work has covered a range of topics including evolutionary genetics, artificial life, machine learning, computational biology and bioinformatics.

I have been programming seriously since 2008 and am expert in R and fluent in Python and Clojure (which is rapidly becoming my favourite language of all). I also speak conversational Common Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, Processing, Bash, SQL and Stata. I have skills and experience in acquiring, processing, modelling and visualising large and complicated datasets. My hacking interests at the moment are functional programming and exploring the possibilities of using R for general-purpose scripting.  I am always interested in discussing new startup ideas in the North West.

I am a dad of two girls, an avid reader, connoisseur of lo-fi indie pop and occasional flamenco guitarist.
