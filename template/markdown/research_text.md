I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Manchester.
I work with large-scale Electronic Medical Record Databases containing millions of electronically captured doctor-patient consultations across hundreds of GP practices in order to address important questions in public health. I am also doing methodological work looking at the validity of such databases. 

I am the developer of the [ClinicalCodes.org](http://www.clinicalcodes.org) repository for lists of clinical codes to facilitate data re-use and re-analysis in observational database research. The site will be live very soon. Follow [@medcodes](http://twitter.com/medcodes) for news on this project.

My PhD was in Evolutionary biology and I am involved in research into plastic and genetic responses to environmental changes, particularly in respect to human-mediated climate change. I have also collaborated on projects in ecology and machine learning in phylogenetics.

I am also interested in using text-mining and natural language processing to perform meta-analyses of large corpora in the scientific literature. [Here](http://vimeo.com/38628200) is a short screencast describing a project involving [text-mining the ecology literature for species interaction data](https://github.com/bergmanlab/ecologIE).")
