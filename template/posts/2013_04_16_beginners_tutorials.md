% R tutorials subsetting vectorisation

Two R tutorials for beginners
=============================

I am currently in the process of rescuing some of the pages from my now defunct datajujitsu.co.uk blogger blog and moving to this Github/Clojure/Bootstrap version.  I also today gave a tutorial to the University of Manchester on data cleaning and subsetting, so I am killing two birds with one stone by linking to the [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/) pages for both this and a short tutorial I gave last year on vectorisation.

The tutorials are:

1. [Subsetting in R: Spring cleaning your data](http://rpubs.com/daspringate/subsetting)
2. [Speeding up your R code - vectorisation tricks for beginners](http://rpubs.com/daspringate/vectorisation)

The R markdown source file for both of these are available on [my github page](https://github.com/DASpringate/tutorials). Rpubs is a great site from the people behind RStudio that allows you to upload R markdown scripts compiled using Knitr in no time at all.  

Using R Markdown, Knitr, RStudio and Rpubs to produce and publish tutorials has proved a complete joy.  It is simple, quick and painless to get pages online with embedded R code and output.  

I have also produced a slide presentation for an internal seminar series in my department using R Markdown, Knitr, Pandoc and Beamer. I was really pleased with the results (Which are also on my [github page](https://github.com/DASpringate/tutorials/tree/master/Primary_Care_Databases/March_2013)) and how easily I was able to achieve them, particularly with  the huge reduction of Latex boilerplate I was forced to write.  I will be doing all of my presentations with this method in future and will blog about the workflow for doing so in due course.
